To be fair, it was a terrible trainnig from that company. It was so simple and they didn't take the time to train me well. I was fully honest about my expertise at that time. However, they were agree to hire me cause they are going to gave me a 3 month training that never happends. Finally I got fired 4 months later without any option.
